# M S Dhoni Still fit to Bat ???

Hello Everyone,
lets try to find answer for this question using Statistics and Data Analysis.

Mahendra Singh Dhoni ( MSD ) is the Player who is playing Chennai Super Kings ( CSK ) from 2008 to 2021 ( excluding 2016 & 2017 where CSK was not part of IPL).

From 2008 to 2021, MSD has scored 4172 runs for CSK in IPL and Total Runs made by CSK in IPL from start to end are 29569. This Shows MSD has scored 14.11 % of Team's Total Runs.

But in Last 2 Seasons, MSD has a contribution of 200 & 114 runs respectively against 2095 & 2607 runs of whole team. This shows MSD's Contribution is only 9.5 % and 4.37 % respectively in year 2020 and 2021.

Then, If we look into Stats from Wicket's perspective, MSD has lost his wicket to Varun Chakravarthy ( Leg Spinner ) 4 times in 6 Innings for last 3 IPL years. and he has an average of 92.97 Strike Rate in Last 3 Years against all bowlers.

These Stats shows us that from last 2-3 Years,

1. his Batting Performance is not so good.
2. He is demoting himself in batting order.
3. He has too low Strike Rate considering the T20 Format.
